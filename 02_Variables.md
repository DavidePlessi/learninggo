# Declaration
`var name string = "value"`
- `var`: we are about to create a new variable
- `name`: the name of the variable
- `string`: the type
- `= "value"`: assign the value to the variable  
In this case `string` in not necessary we can also use: `name := "value"`. We only use this syntax to declare new 
variables.   
Go is what we refer to as a **statically typed** language.  
# Some basic types
- bool
- string
- int
- float64
